# Additional Server for the Database:

## Why Add It: 
Separating the database onto its own server isolates the database workload from application logic and web serving functions. This improves performance by allowing the database to use dedicated resources and enhances security by limiting access to the database server.

# HAproxy Cluster Configuration:

## Why Add It: 
Configuring HAproxy as a cluster with another HAproxy instance provides high availability and redundancy for the load balancing function. If one HAproxy server fails, the other can take over, ensuring that there is no single point of failure in directing traffic to the web and application servers. This setup is crucial for maintaining uninterrupted service.

# Split Components Across Servers:

## Web Server on Its Own Server: 
Isolating the web server (Nginx) on its own server allows it to efficiently handle static content and SSL termination without being bogged down by application logic processing. It optimizes the delivery of web content to users.
## Application Server on Its Own Server: 
Having the application server on a separate server focuses resources on executing application logic and serving dynamic content. This separation from the web serving layer and the database layer allows for more efficient scaling and management of the application processing workload.
